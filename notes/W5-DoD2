Theory to review

SLO/SLA:
SLO (Service Level Objective) is a goal for reliability that you set internally for your software while the SLA (Service Level Agreement) is like a contract with the users that you are going to meet certain levels of service and the penalties if you don't meet them.

Rate vs. ratio:
Rate measures how often something happens in a period of time, for example, 10 requests per second. Ratio measures part of a something in proportion. For example, 1 error for every 10 requests. 

Sliding windows:
It means analizing data within a time range, so you always get the most updated data. For example, if you have a report that shows how many logins are on a website in the past 30 days, the 30-day window is constantly moving showing you the latest data for the last 30 days.

file parsing:
File parsing is when a script reads and coverts the raw data of a file into something the script can work with. 

Reporting:
is taking raw data and making it into summaries, tables, dashboards to make it easy to read and actions can be taken.

Five self-questions:

What is an error budget?
he amount of failure a system is allowed before breaking the SLO.

Example: If SLO = 99.9% uptime, error budget = 0.1% downtime allowed.

How to compute burn rate?
Burn rate = (actual error rate) ÷ (allowed error rate). It shows how fast you’re using up your error budget.

Why parse with streaming?
It helps process large files reading it line by line instead of loading everything into the memory all at once. 

What are edge cases?
Extreme and abnormal inputs that the code doesn't usually expect. 

How to print help tex?
You can type the command and --help.
